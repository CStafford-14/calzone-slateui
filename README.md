# Calzone SlateUI
SlateUI Theme for the Calzone Web UI

Calzone requires a theme to run. SlateUI (The default theme) currently supports most of Calzone's functions.

Put the theme in Calzone's working directory like this:
`./websource/static/[add, common, manage, today]`

Soon, managing themes will be easier as you only have to drop SlateUI's folder into the `static` folder
`./websource/static/slateui/[add, common, manage, today]`

When more themes become available, you will be able to install them alongside each other and use a configuration file to determine which theme to use.
